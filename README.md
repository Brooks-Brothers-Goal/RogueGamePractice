# RogueGamePractice


## Ideas
Turn Based - Dungeon Crawler
- Rogue Like aspects (Party based)
    - New run every time
    - Can leave if not in combat (?)
    - Upgrade town outside of delving(?) 
    - Not necessarily until death (With some penalty if death?)
    - Vision! (Can see Terrain, not what's going on)

## Gameplay Choices
- Classes?
- Items for sure
- Multiple Characters - that can stack up to 2 on a tile (Should be interesting for multi player as well)

## Party details
- Persons per square, 2 (for now)
- Standard party is 4 (for now)
- Stats (Simplified Stats - decided by the maker)

## Items
### Weapons
- Damage is simple range (For Now)
- Plan on being able to improve in some way

### Skill Books
- One time Use!
- Limit on number of skill books to use (somehow)

## Terrain
- For now plan on complete Random Generation
- Need to plan details about the Terrain to work
- Dungeon Tileset (style, squares)


## Gameplay Goals/Project Goals
- Strategic battles/instead of "simple"
- Simplicity first, planning for extension/improvement second


# OUTLINES TO DO
- Weapon
- Character
- Player actions (how to choose options and the like)
- How Abilities will interact with Character
- Terrain Generator (how to get the map and the like)
- Graphics :(

# Interesting Ideas for future

- Have 4 or so maps that as players are used as a map and then certain areas cause the player to "switch" which map they are on
- Maybe have different Dungeon "seeds" -
